		<p id="disclaimer"><strong>Cost of treatments</strong> These are indicative prices of common NHS procedures for adults, selected in a list of 1,300 with the help of the NHS statistical services, and based on the 2015/16 National Tariff Payment System draft national prices. As NHS tariffs vary according to whether the procedure is elective (scheduled stay in hospital), non-elective (unscheduled stay) or for outpatients (no overnight stay), prices shown here are for the most common tariff applied in practice, or the average of tariffs is there is not a single most common one. Similarly, the prices are shown for the most common level of complications for the procedure (either major, intermediate, minor, or no complications). The price shown is for a stay of average length in hospital for the specific procedure considered - additional days of stay in hospital above a certain threshold will increase the total price. Prices also vary locally since, in addition to the core prices, hospitals receive an additional amount to account for unavoidable cost differences between different hospitals due to geographical location. <strong>Estimation of total costs by age, gender and GP use</strong>Estimates provided by the Nuffield Trust relying on data from HM Treasury, for 2013/14 for the whole of the UK. Figures for the community health care sector are extrapolated as there is currently no data available on the use of these services by age and gender.</p>
